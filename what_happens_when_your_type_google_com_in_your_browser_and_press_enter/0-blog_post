# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?

The question *“What happens when you type a URL and press Enter?”* is widely regarded as a classic interview question in software engineering. Although it appears simple on the surface, it covers critical aspects of computer networking, security, and system design. This article provides a step-by-step explanation of the entire workflow involved when you type **https://www.google.com** into your browser and press **Enter**.

## 1. DNS Resolution
The first step is to resolve the human-readable domain name into an IP address.  
- The browser first checks its own cache.  
- If not available, the operating system resolver is consulted.  
- If still unresolved, the request is sent to a recursive DNS server (often provided by your ISP or Google DNS such as `8.8.8.8`).  
- The recursive server queries authoritative DNS servers until the IP address for `www.google.com` is found.  

At this stage, the browser knows the server’s IP address.

## 2. Establishing a TCP/IP Connection
Once the IP address is known, the browser initiates a **TCP connection**:  
- The connection is established through the **three-way handshake** (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK).  
- This handshake ensures reliability, ordering, and error-checking for transmitted packets.  
- The communication is carried over the **Internet Protocol (IP)** and routed across multiple network devices before reaching Google’s infrastructure.

---

## 3. Firewall Inspection
Before reaching Google’s internal systems, the packets pass through **firewalls**:  
- Firewalls apply predefined security rules.  
- Malicious or unauthorized traffic is blocked.  
- Only valid requests (such as HTTPS traffic on port 443) are allowed to pass.  

This ensures that the connection is both secure and controlled.

## 4. HTTPS and SSL/TLS Handshake
Since the request uses **HTTPS**, encryption is mandatory:  
- The browser and the server perform an **SSL/TLS handshake**.  
- The handshake negotiates encryption algorithms and establishes session keys.  
- The server provides a **digital certificate** issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  
- The process guarantees:  
  - **Confidentiality**: Data is encrypted.  
  - **Integrity**: Data cannot be altered in transit.  
  - **Authentication**: The browser confirms it is indeed communicating with Google.

## 5. Load Balancing
Google’s infrastructure is distributed across the globe. A single server cannot handle all incoming requests:  
- A **load balancer** distributes requests among multiple backend servers.  
- This improves scalability, ensures availability, and optimizes response time.  
- Load balancers may also perform **health checks** to ensure requests are routed only to functional servers.

---

## 6. Web Server
The request is directed to a **web server** (for example, Nginx or Google’s proprietary system):  
- The web server handles the incoming HTTP request.  
- It serves static resources such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.  
- For dynamic content, it forwards the request to the application server.

---

## 7. Application Server
The **application server** executes the application logic:  
- In the case of Google Search, the application server processes the query string provided by the user.  
- It may interact with other services, ranking algorithms, personalization modules, or distributed systems.  

This is where the “business logic” resides.

---

## 8. Database Query
For most applications, data must be retrieved from a **database**:  
- The application server issues queries to Google’s distributed database systems such as **Bigtable** or **Spanner**.  
- The database retrieves and returns the required structured data.  
- This information is then processed and sent back to the application server.

---

## 9. Response Transmission
The application server sends the processed data back to the web server.  
The web server then constructs an **HTTP response** and sends it back to the client through:  
- Load balancer  
- Firewalls  
- The internet backbone  
- ISP routers and local networks  

Eventually, the response reaches the user’s browser.

---

## 10. Browser Rendering
Upon receiving the response, the browser performs the following steps:  
- Parses the HTML.  
- Builds the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.  
- Downloads and applies CSS styles.  
- Executes JavaScript.  
- Renders the final visual interface.  

Within milliseconds, the familiar Google Search homepage is displayed.

## Conclusion
Typing `https://www.google.com` and pressing Enter triggers a sophisticated series of operations that span across networking, security, distributed systems, and client-side rendering. Understanding this process demonstrates mastery of fundamental computer science concepts and provides valuable insight for both academic study and technical interviews.
